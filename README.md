# AusEFlux: Empirical upscaling of terrestrial carbon fluxes over Australia using the OzFlux eddy covariance network


The notebooks in this repository describe the research methods used in the [EGU Biogeosciences publication](https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4109-2023):

AusEFlux (**Aus**tralian **E**mpirical **Flux**es) is a high resolution (1 km) gridded estimate of Gross Primary Productivity, Ecosystem Respiration, and Net Ecosystem Exchange over the Australian continent for the period January 2003 to June 2022.  This new estimate of Australia’s terrestrial carbon cycle provides a benchmark for assessment against Land Surface Model simulations, and a means for monitoring of Australia’s terrestrial carbon cycle at an unprecedented high-resolution.

The results of this analysis, saved as netcdfs, can be accessed at Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7947265.

The notebooks are intended to be read/run in order of their labelling, i.e., 1 - 9. However, its unlikley if you clone this repo you could run the analysis as its dependent on a large python environment (not described here), and datasets that are stored on the NCI (where this analysis was run).
